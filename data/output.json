  "text": " Good job. Glad to see things are going well and business is starting to pick up. Andrea told me about your outstanding numbers on Tuesday. Keep up the good work. Now to other business, I am going to suggest a payment schedule for the outstanding money that is due. One, can you pay the balance of the license agreement as soon as possible? Two, I suggest we set up or you suggest what you can pay on the back rawties. What do you feel comfortable with paying every two weeks? Every month. I would like to keep, I would like to catch up and maintain current royalties. So if we can start current royalties and maintain them every two weeks as all stores are required to do, I would appreciate it. Let me know if this works for you. Thanks.",
